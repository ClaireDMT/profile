# Le Wagon Challenge on Week 4, first day of Front-End


Instructions:

You'll cover a lot of HTML & CSS concepts in the next few days, such as:

    HTML skeleton and common tags (in <head> and <body>)
    CSS simple and advanced selectors
    Web-design resources for fonts & colors (google fonts, fontawesome, etc.)

The objective of this day is to build your profile page and put it online using Github Pages.
